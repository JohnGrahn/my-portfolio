## Exam Preparation Resources

1. **Microsoft Learn**: Microsoft's official learning platform offers a comprehensive [AZ-104 learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104) that covers all the exam objectives. The modules include interactive exercises and hands-on labs, making it an excellent resource for practical learning.

2. **Azure Documentation**: The [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/) is an invaluable resource for in-depth information on Azure services and features. I found myself frequently referring to the documentation during my exam preparation to gain a deeper understanding of various topics.

3. **Practice Exams**: Taking practice exams helped me assess my readiness and identify areas that needed improvement. I used the official Microsoft practice test and also found some great practice exams on platforms like Udemy and Whizlabs.

4. **Hands-on Experience**: Nothing beats hands-on experience when it comes to learning Azure. I made sure to spend time working with Azure services, creating resources, configuring settings, and troubleshooting issues. The Azure free tier and free sandbox environments provided by Microsoft Learn were great for practicing without incurring costs. Additionally, the [AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator) repository on GitHub offers a collection of lab exercises and materials to further enhance your hands-on skills.

## Exam Experience and Thoughts

The AZ-104 exam consists of a mix of multiple-choice and scenario-based questions. The questions cover a wide range of Azure administration topics, including:

- Managing Azure identities and governance
- Implementing and managing storage
- Deploying and managing Azure compute resources
- Configuring and managing virtual networking
- Monitoring and backing up Azure resources

I found the exam to be challenging but fair. The questions were well-structured and tested practical knowledge rather than just memorization. Having hands-on experience with Azure definitely helped me navigate through the scenario-based questions.

One piece of advice I would give to anyone preparing for the AZ-104 exam is to focus on understanding the core concepts and services. While it's important to know the specific steps and commands, it's equally crucial to grasp the underlying principles and best practices.

## Code Example

Here's an example of how you can create an Azure resource group using the Azure CLI:

az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

## Conclusion

Passing the AZ-104 Associate Azure Administrator exam has been a significant milestone in my career as a software engineer working with Azure. The exam preparation process not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of Azure services and best practices.

If you're considering taking the AZ-104 exam, I highly recommend utilizing the resources mentioned above and gaining hands-on experience with Azure. It's a challenging but rewarding journey that will validate your expertise in Azure administration.
